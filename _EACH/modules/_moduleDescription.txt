Name of module: Size exclusion chromatography modeling

The Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) module simulates protein fractionation using realistic, 
manufacturer-specified SEC columns. Users select one column at a time from an extended list covering 
a wide range of pore sizes and molecular-weight separation windows. The model assumes ideal SEC 
behavior and relies exclusively on the published fractionation range of the chosen column. Proteins
are retained or removed based on whether their molecular weight falls inside or outside the column’s
specified range. The output is a single SDS-PAGE image representing the expected SEC fraction, providing
a clear and physically motivated comparison between different column choices.
